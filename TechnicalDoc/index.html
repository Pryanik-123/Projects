                <p>Unity is a great tool for prototyping everything from games,
                     to interactive visualisations. In this article,
                      we run through all you need to know to get started using Unity.</p>
                <p>This article is aimed at anyone who has never used Unity before, 
                    but has some previous experience programming or in web design / development.
                     By the end of this article, you should have a good general overview of the engine
                      as well as all the necessary functions and code to start making a basic game.</p>
                <p>Here are the most important things you have to learn before you get going:</p>
                <ul>

                <p>Unity gives users the ability to create games and experiences
                     in both 2D and 3D, and the engine offers a primary scripting API
                      in C# using Mono, for both the Unity editor in the form of
                       plugins, and games themselves, as well as drag and drop
                        functionality.</p>
                <p>Unity simplifies game development by using
                    a component-based architecture, where scripts define behaviors
                     for game objects within 2D or 3D environments. The Unity Editor
                      offers a visual interface for designing games levels, where
                       assets can be arranged to create scenes. Users can drag and
                        drop assets into the editor, such as 3D models, textures, and
                         audio files, and then arrange and configure them to create
                          the desired gameplay experience. C# is the primary scripting language,
                           supported by programming languages like Rust and JavaScript and a
                            wide ecosystem of assets, prefabs, and templates to streamline development.</p>

                <p>By far the most important things you need to know,

            <article>
                <p>C# is a cross-platform general purpose language that makes
                     developers productive while writing highly performant code.
                      With millions of developers, C# is the most popular .NET 
                      language. C# has broad support in the ecosystem and all 
                      .NET workloads. Based on object-oriented principles, it 
                      incorporates many features from other paradigms, not least
                       functional programming. Low-level features support high-efficiency
                        scenarios without writing unsafe code. Most of the .NET runtime
                         and libraries are written in C#, and advances in C# often
                          benefit all .NET developers.</p>

                <p>The "Hello, World" program is traditionally used to
                     introduce a programming language. Here it is in C#:</p>
                <code><span class="green">// This line prints "Hello, World"</span> <br>
                    <span class="light-blue">Console</span>.WriteLine(<span class="orange">"Hello, World"</span>);</code>
                <p>A declaration statement declares a new local variable,
                     local constant, or local reference variable. To declare
                      a local variable, specify its type and provide its name.
                       You can declare multiple variables of the same type in
                        one statement, as the following example shows:</p>
                <code><span class="blue">string</span> greeting; <br>
                    <span class="blue">int</span> a, b, c; <br>
                    <span class="blue">const string</span> Greeting = "Hello"; <br>
                    <span class="blue">const double</span> MinLimit = -10.0;</code>
                <p>Local functions are methods of a type that are nested in another member. They can only be called from their containing member</p>
                <p>Local functions make the intent of your code clear. Anyone reading your code can see that the method isn't callable except by
                     the containing method. For team projects, they also make it impossible for another developer to mistakenly call the method
                      directly from elsewhere in the class or struct.</p>
                <code><span class="blue">public static void</span> Main(){ <br>
                    <span class="code-padding"><span class="light-blue">Console</span>.WriteLine(<span class="orange">"Hello"</span>);</span> <br>
                    }</code>
                <p>The if, if-else and switch statements select statements to execute from many possible paths
                     based on the value of an expression. The if statement executes a statement only if a provided
                      Boolean expression evaluates to true. The if-else statement allows you to choose which of
                       the two code paths to follow based on a Boolean expression. The switch statement selects a
                        statement list to execute based on a pattern match with an expression.</p>
                <code><span class="purple">if</span> (<span class="blue">True</span>) { <br>
                    <span class="code-padding"><span class="light-blue">Console</span>.WriteLine(<span class="orange">"True"</span>);</span> <br>
                }</code>
                <p>You can store multiple variables of the same type in an array data structure.
                     You declare an array by specifying the type of its elements. If you want
                      the array to store elements of any type, you can specify object as its type.
                       In the unified type system of C#, all types, predefined and user-defined,
                        reference types and value types, inherit directly or indirectly from Object.</p>
                <code><span class="blue">int</span>[] numbers = <span class="light-blue">new</span> <span class="blue">int</span>[10]; <span class="green">// All values are 0</span> <br>
                    <span class="blue">string</span>[] messages = <span class="light-blue">new</span> <span class="blue">string</span>[10]; <span class="green">// All values are null</span></code>

                <p>Its not everything about C#, there are a lot more things for you to learn. These are just some of the basics, more can be found on

            <article>
                <p>The usual advice for learning game dev/Unity is to not jump into your dream game project.
                    Make a handful of small games, increasingly complex, to apply the things you are learning.
                     Not for release or anything, just projects that allow you to implement the things you are learning.
                    This gives you some experience in conceptualizing, designing, and then developing a lot of the basic
                     skills and techniques that you will need to start working on your big horror game. Jumping straight
                      into working on your dream game as your first game project is probably the leading cause of people
                       getting frustrated and quitting. Start small and master the basics.</p>
                <p>Don't learn programming by starting with Unity, start with the language first, then patterns so you're not learning a tool (Unity)</p>
                <p>Don't get stuck in tutorial hell, you'll grow to be very dependable on tutorials, which is not something you need to aim for. Try
                    to create stuff on your own, and only depend on tutorials to learn something new.
